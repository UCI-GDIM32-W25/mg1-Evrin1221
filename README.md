## Devlog

Evrin Lee, she/her

In the in class activity we said that a game controller (in this case the UI script) keeps track of the number of seeds and displays it on the UI text. This is done by the UpdateSeeds() method. We also mentioned that we need a speed variable for the movement which I referenced in the Update() method. We also mentioned that we could keep track of the seeds in a list but seeing how it was already set up I didn't need to do that I just set the PlantSeeds() method to only do something if the number of seeds left (_numSeedsLeft) was greater than 0
